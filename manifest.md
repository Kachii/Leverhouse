Hello! This is a manifest for Leverhouse. It strives to serve as an aggrerator of software engineering jobs and internship
from companies that use the Lever and Greenhouse for there ATS. It works by maintaining a list of companies and updating the
list of available jobs. Upon finding a new job, Leverhouse notifies the user to check out the job listing. Then, the user
can elect to apply to the job using a stored resume and information profile. Later, I want to look toward more of optimization
of resumes and adding support for more ATSs.
